	<h2>Invitations</h2>
		<p>A few images for y'all</p>
		<img src="images/Paper & Envelopes for Invitations.jpg" alt="The paper and envelopes we have chosen"/>
		<ul>
			<li>This is the paper & envelopes we have chosen for making our invitations. The paper is called Paper Bag and the envelopes are Curry. The website for the store (which we found in Birmingham) is <a href="http://www.paper-source.com">Paper Source</a>. </li>
		</ul>
		<img src="images/Paint Stamp Beta.jpg" alt="My attempt at a paint stamp"/>
		<ul>
			<li>My first attempts at making orange slice stamps to go with our Citrus & Clove theme were with paint. Some of them turned out ok, but we're going to try it with ink pads next. Paint was too squishy.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I have no idea what Brial Shower & Bachelorette Party invitations should look like, but my friend Jeanne had both invitations sent to me at the same time. We should do it like that, just slip in our B-Party invites with the Bridal Shower. We could get together with a few of the people who have offered to help and just buy a bunch of rubber cement and print out some images or what not and make invites one day. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>These are my favorite cards by my favorite artist, Gwen Frostic. She was a Northern Michigan artist and her business is still going. I wish my invitations would look like her stuff. Maybe we can order them for the Bridal Shower? They were actually the first inspiration for what our wedding should look & feel like :) </li>

	<h2>Bridal Shower</h2>
		<p>Katie and I are thinking brunch. It should be easy, relaxed. I still haven't called All Saints' yet about using their auditorium (my bad) but we also don't have a date yet, do we? Memosas? Bacon? Quische? Cheese & Fruit? The reason why I'd like to use All Saints' is that it is relatively close to my home, I work there, and many of our downstate guests can easily make it. Plus, the auditorium can seat like 200 people and has a full kitchen, dishes, silverware, chairs, tables, etc which I'm pretty sure we can use. Again, sorry, I need to call.</p?>
	<h2>Bachelorette Party</h2>
		<p>Katie and I discussed this a bit. We considered that both Taylor & Jen will be living out of state in September, so we will try to set aside just one weekend and the Bachelorette Party will be the same day as the Bridal Shower. If that works out. Katie's in charge, obviously. Since Taylor already has a wedding to attend in September, should we also consider an earlier (August?) party?</p>
	<h2>Pre-Wedding Events</h2>

			<li>Dinner & Movie Series</li>
			<li>Friday, Oct 19: Welcome at Leelanau Cellars/The Knot</li>
			<li>Rehearsal and Rehearsal Dinner(?)<li>
