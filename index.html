	<h2>Bridal Shower</h2>
		<p>Katie and I are thinking brunch. It should be easy, relaxed. I still haven't called All Saints' yet about using their auditorium (my bad) but we also don't have a date yet, do we? Memosas? Bacon? Quische? Cheese & Fruit? The reason why I'd like to use All Saints' is that it is relatively close to my home, I work there, and many of our downstate guests can easily make it. Plus, the auditorium can seat like 200 people and has a full kitchen, dishes, silverware, chairs, tables, etc which I'm pretty sure we can use. Again, sorry, I need to call.</p?>
	<h2>Bachelorette Party</h2>
		<p>Katie and I discussed this a bit. We considered that both Taylor & Jen will be living out of state in September, so we will try to set aside just one weekend and the Bachelorette Party will be the same day as the Bridal Shower. If that works out. Katie's in charge, obviously. Since Taylor already has a wedding to attend in September, should we also consider an earlier (August?) party?</p>
